# AI Engineering Study Repository 🚀  
### Learning AI Through Stories + Systems Thinking

This repository documents my structured journey into AI Engineering —  
where I break down complex AI concepts using **storytelling, systems thinking, and hands-on experiments**.

Instead of just reading theory, I aim to **understand AI deeply by explaining it like a story**, then connecting it back to production system design.

Currently studying:  
**AI Engineering – Chip Huyen**

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Data Engineer with a background in software development (Python) and cloud-based data systems.  
Experienced in building scalable data pipelines and production workflows.  
Currently transitioning deeper into AI Engineering and production LLM systems.

I believe the best way to truly understand AI is to:
- Explain it simply
- Model it as a system
- Break it down into stories
- Then rebuild it technically

## 📖 How I Learn AI

This repository is different from typical note dumps.

I use:
- 🧠 Storytelling to build intuition  
- 🔍 Deep technical breakdowns to solidify understanding  
- ⚙️ Small experiments to test assumptions  
- 🏗 System design thinking to connect everything  

If I cannot explain a concept as a story,  
I assume I don’t fully understand it yet.

Not just someone who *uses* AI —  
but someone who understands how it works under the hood and builds systems around its probabilistic nature.

This repository is my attempt to do exactly that.
